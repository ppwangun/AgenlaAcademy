Introduction
============

DoctrineModule provides a bridge between `Laminas <https://getlaminas.org/>`__ and Doctrine. It
gives you access to features that can be used across
`Doctrine ORM <https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/current/index.html>`__ as well as
`Doctrine MongoDB ODM <https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-mongodb-odm/en/current/index.html>`__.
It provides an abstraction layer on top of
`Doctrine\Common <https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/current/index.html>`__
which allows the end user to build functionality being completely unaware if heâ€™s currently working
with Doctrine ORM or Doctrine MongoDB ODM.

To use Doctrine ORM or ODM, you will need
`DoctrineORMModule <https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm-module/en/current/index.html>`__ or
`DoctrineMongoODMModule <https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-mongo-odm-module/en/current/index.html>`__
respectively.

Installation
------------

Run the following to install this library using `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`__:

.. code:: bash

   $ composer require doctrine/doctrine-module
